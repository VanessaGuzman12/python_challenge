Pyhton Homework

I created two Python scripts:
First script is analyzing the financial records of the company.
Second script is counting the voting process.

I export both analysis into a .txt file

Comment:
I have to use a local path because for a unknown reason (for me :>) the os.path.join did not work in my script
I commented my local path that I used while working
